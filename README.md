# ansible-role-tsdproxy

Integrate TSDProdx into the [MASH-Playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook), to proxy services into your [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) network.

It is mandatory to set following variables:

```yaml
tsdproxy_tailscale_authkey: '' # OR
tsdproxy_tailscale_authkeyfile: '' # use this to load authkey from file. If this is defined, Authkey is ignored
```

By default, the container will mount the docker socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`, but you can change that by setting `tsdproxy_docker_socket` to something else. Don't forget to adjust the `tsdproxy_docker_endpoint_is_unix_socket` to false, if you are using a tcp endpoint.

If [com.devture.ansible.role.container_socket_proxy](https://github.com/devture/com.devture.ansible.role.container_socket_proxy) is installed by the playbook (default), the container will use the proxy.

If not, the container will mount the docker socket at `/var/run/docker.sock`, but you can change that by setting `tsdproxy_docker_socket` to something else. Don't forget to adjust the `tsdproxy_docker_endpoint_is_unix_socket` to false if you are using a tcp endpoint.

## Add a new Service

This proxy creates for each service a own machine in the Tailscale network, without creating each time a sidecar container. To add a new service, you have to make sure that the service and proxy are in a same docker network. You can do this by adding the proxy to the network of the service or the otTSDProxyher way round.

```yaml
tsdproxy_container_additional_networks_custom:
  - YOUR-SERVICE-NETWORK
# OR
YOUR-SERVICE_container_additional_networks_custom:
  - "{{ tsdproxy_container_network }}"
```

The next step is to add the service to the proxy.

### Via docker labels

```yaml
YOUR-SERVICE_container_labels_additional_labels: |
  tsdproxy.enable: "true"
  tsdproxy.container_port: 8080
```

Following labels are optional, please read the [official TSDProxy documentation](https://almeidapaulopt.github.io/tsdproxy/docs/docker/) for more information.

```yaml
  tsdproxy.name: "my-service"
  tsdproxy.autodetect: "false"
  tsdproxy.proxyprovider: "providername"
  tsdproxy.ephemeral: "false"
  tsdproxy.funnel: "false"
```

### Via Proxy list

An alternative way to add a service to the proxy is to use Proxy files. Please read the [official TSDProxy documentation](https://almeidapaulopt.github.io/tsdproxy/docs/files/) for more information.

You will need to use the `tsdproxy_config_files` variable and add your proxy list file into the config folder, most likely `/mash/tsdproxy/config/`. This is possible manually or by using [AUX-Files](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook/blob/main/docs/services/auxiliary.md).

## Development

You can optionally install a Git pre-commit hook (via [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) + [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/)) that runs formatting and linting checks before each commit. See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml) for which hooks are to be executed.

To install the hook, run the [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) command below:

```sh
just prek-install-git-pre-commit-hook
```
